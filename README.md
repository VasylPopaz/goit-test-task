This Tweets application is built using React and Redux Toolkit. The app allows
users to view tweets, manage subscriptions to other users, and filter users
based on status.

# Functionality

   all users.

2. Manage followings Users can follow other users. On the tweets page, there is
   a "Follow" button that allows users to manage their followings.

3. Filter Tweets by Status There is an option to filter tweets by following the
   status. Users can choose a specific status, such as "Show All", "Follow",
   "Followings", to view tweets that match the selected status.

4. Pagination The tweets are displayed in sets of three cards per page.

5. Load More A "Load More" button is available at the bottom of the tweet list.
