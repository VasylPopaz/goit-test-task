# Tweets App

Welcome to Tweets! This web application allows you to explore tweets from
various users.

# Functionality

1. The Home page greets you with a welcoming headline and a "Get Started"
   button. Clicking this button will direct you to the Tweets page.

2. On the Tweets page, you can view the number of tweets, followers, and the
   user's avatar. Additionally, you have the option to follow a user by clicking
   the "Follow" button. To navigate back through your browser history, you can
   use the "Go Back" button.

3. User Filtering You can filter users based on their Follow status, with three
   options:

   - Show All - displays all users
   - Follow - displays users you don't follow
   - Following - displays users you are following

4. Pagination The tweets are displayed in sets of three cards per page.

5. A "Load More" button is available at the bottom of the user list. Clicking
   this button dynamically loads the next set of three cards.

6. "Scroll Up" button becomes visible after the user scrolls down the page. When
   the button is clicked, the page will scroll to the top, and the button will
   hide again.
